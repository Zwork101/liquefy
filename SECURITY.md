# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions of liquefy are currently being supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a vunderability, be sure to be very specific about what it is, and create a PoC to prove it works. You'll be updated when a fix has been made and when it's been published. Only when the fix has been published should you share the vunderability publicly.

## Reward

This is a small project of mine, and does not get my full attension. I'm not awarding any monetary prizes at the moment, however your name will be added to the README.
